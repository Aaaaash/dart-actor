# dart_actor

An experimental library for Actor in dart. 

Idealy, Actor should be implemented by [Isolate](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.7.1/dart-isolate/dart-isolate-library.html), but now it's more like event emitter, But it's enough for me and my other package.

If you are looking for a better Actor, please don't use it.
